def maxHeightOfTriangle(red: int, blue: int) -> int:
    """
    You are given two integers red and blue representing the count of red and blue colored balls. You have to arrange these balls to form a triangle such that the 1st row will have 1 ball, the 2nd row will have 2 balls, the 3rd row will have 3 balls, and so on.
    All the balls in a particular row should be the same color, and adjacent rows should have different colors.
    Return the maximum height of the triangle that can be achieved.
    
    Examples:
    >>> maxHeightOfTriangle(2, 4)
    3
    
    >>> maxHeightOfTriangle(2, 1)
    2
    
    >>> maxHeightOfTriangle(1, 1)
    1
    
    >>> maxHeightOfTriangle(10, 1)
    2
    
    
    Constraints:
    1 <= red, blue <= 100
