def getEncryptedString(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    """
    You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:
    
    For each character c in s, replace c with the k-th character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).
    Return the encrypted string.
    
    Example:
    >>> getEncryptedString('dart', 3)
    'tdar'
    
    >>> getEncryptedString('aaa', 1)
    'aaa'
    
    Constraints:
    
    1 <= s.length <= 100
    1 <= k <= 10^4
    s consists only of lowercase English letters.
