def minimumAverage(nums: List[int]) -> float:
    """
    You have an array of floating point numbers averages which is initially empty. You are given an array nums of n integers where n is even.
    
    You repeat the following procedure n / 2 times:
    
    Remove the smallest element, minElement, and the largest element maxElement, from nums.
    Add (minElement + maxElement) / 2 to averages.
    Return the minimum element in averages.
    
    Examples:
    >>> minimumAverage([7,8,3,4,15,13,4,1])
    5.5
    
    >>> minimumAverage([1,9,8,3,10,5])
    5.5
    
    >>> minimumAverage([1,2,3,7,8,9])
    5.0
    
    Constraints:
    
    2 <= n == nums.length <= 50
    n is even.
    1 <= nums[i] <= 50
