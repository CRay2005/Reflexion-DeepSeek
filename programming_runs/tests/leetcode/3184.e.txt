def countCompleteDayPairs(hours: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Given an integer array hours representing times in hours, return an integer denoting the number of pairs i, j where i < j and hours[i] + hours[j] forms a complete day.
    
    A complete day is defined as a time duration that is an exact multiple of 24 hours.
    
    For example, 1 day is 24 hours, 2 days is 48 hours, 3 days is 72 hours, and so on.
    
    Examples:
    >>> countCompleteDayPairs([12,12,30,24,24])
    2
    
    >>> countCompleteDayPairs([72,48,24,3])
    3
    
    Constraints:
    1 <= hours.length <= 100
    1 <= hours[i] <= 10^9
