To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

Tests failed:
assert fibfib(7) == 15 # output: 13

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test case for `fibfib(7)` because it incorrectly calculates the sequence value for `n = 7`. The error arises from the misunderstanding of the sequence definition. The function correctly initializes the sequence with `[0, 0, 1]` but fails to correctly compute the subsequent values by incorrectly summing the last three elements of the sequence. The correct approach should be to sum the values of `fibfib(n-1)`, `fibfib(n-2)`, and `fibfib(n-3)` directly, not the last three elements of the list. This oversight leads to an incorrect computation of the sequence value for `n = 7`.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case where the expected result was 6 but the actual output was 10. The issue arises because the function incorrectly handles the precedence of operations when converting the infix expression to postfix notation. Specifically, the while loop condition `while stack and precedence[stack[-1]] >= precedence[operators[i]]:` does not correctly handle the precedence of exponentiation (`**`) relative to other operations. This leads to the incorrect order of operations in the postfix expression, resulting in an incorrect final evaluation. To fix this, the precedence handling in the `infix_to_postfix` function should be adjusted to correctly manage the order of operations, especially when dealing with exponentiation.

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert do_algebra(['+', '**', '-'], [2, 3, 2, 1]) == 6 # output: 10

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test case where the expected result was 6 but the actual output was 10. The issue arises because the function incorrectly handles the precedence of operations when converting the infix expression to postfix notation. Specifically, the while loop condition `while stack and precedence[stack[-1]] >= precedence[operators[i]]:` does not correctly handle the precedence of exponentiation (`**`) relative to other operations. This leads to the incorrect order of operations in the postfix expression, resulting in an incorrect final evaluation. To fix this, the precedence handling in the `infix_to_postfix` function should be adjusted to correctly manage the order of operations, especially when dealing with exponentiation.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case because it incorrectly handles the precedence of operations when converting the infix expression to postfix notation. The current implementation does not correctly prioritize operations with higher precedence, leading to incorrect evaluation of the expression. Specifically, the issue arises because the while loop condition `while stack and precedence[stack[-1]] > precedence[operators[i]]:` does not account for equal precedence operations, which should be handled according to the associativity rules (left-to-right for most operations). This results in the incorrect order of operations, leading to an incorrect final result. To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to consider equal precedence operations and their associativity.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case where the expected output for `tri(3)` is `[3, 3, 2, 8]`, but the actual output was `[1, 3, 2, 8]`. The issue arises from the base case in the `tribonacci` function, which incorrectly returns `3` when `k == 1`. This base case should be adjusted to correctly handle the first element of the sequence. Additionally, the recursive calls in the `tribonacci` function are not correctly following the Tribonacci sequence logic, leading to incorrect values for subsequent elements. The base case and recursive logic need to be revised to accurately compute the Tribonacci sequence.

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(2, 2) == 4 # output: 0

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[improved impl]:

Tests failed:
assert tri(3) == [3, 3, 2, 8] # output: [1, 3, 2, 8]

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test case where the expected output for `tri(3)` is `[3, 3, 2, 8]`, but the actual output was `[1, 3, 2, 8]`. The issue arises from the base case in the `tribonacci` function, which incorrectly returns `3` when `k == 1`. This base case should be adjusted to correctly handle the first element of the sequence. Additionally, the recursive calls in the `tribonacci` function are not correctly following the Tribonacci sequence logic, leading to incorrect values for subsequent elements. The base case and recursive logic need to be revised to accurately compute the Tribonacci sequence.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case for `tri(4)` because it incorrectly handles the base cases and the recurrence relation for even numbers. Specifically, the base case for `tri(1)` is set to 3, but the sequence should start from `tri(0) = 1`. Additionally, the recurrence relation for even numbers is incorrectly implemented as `1 + i // 2`, which does not align with the given definition. The correct approach should be to handle the base cases properly and ensure the recurrence relation for even numbers is correctly applied.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

assert fizz_buzz(350) == 6 # output: 9

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test case where the expected output was 6 but the actual output was 9. The issue in the implementation is that it incorrectly counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers that are divisible by either 11 or 13, without considering the correct range of numbers to check. The function should only consider numbers less than `n`, but the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, which includes numbers equal to `n` when `n` is divisible by 11 or 13. This results in an overcounting of the digit '7'. To fix this, the loop should iterate only up to `n` instead of `n-1`.

Self reflection output: The implementation of the `fizz_buzz` function incorrectly counts numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7'. The issue arises because the function does not correctly implement the logic for the FizzBuzz problem, which typically involves checking for multiples of 3 and 5, not 11 and 13. Additionally, the function is designed to count occurrences based on a specific condition, but the condition itself is not aligned with the typical FizzBuzz rules. This leads to an incorrect count of numbers that meet the specified criteria, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed because it incorrectly counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13. The issue arises from the loop starting from 0, which is not necessary for the problem's requirements since 0 is not divisible by 11 or 13 and does not contain the digit '7'. This leads to an incorrect count of '7's in the numbers that meet the criteria. To fix this, the loop should start from 1 to ensure that only numbers that can be divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7' are considered.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed because it references a variable `grid4` which is not defined within the function or provided in the test case. This indicates a mistake in the test setup rather than an issue with the function implementation itself. The function is designed to work with a grid input, but the test case did not properly define the grid variable `grid4` before using it in the assertion.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first.

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert fib4(10) == 86 # output: 104

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test for `fib4(10)` because the sequence update logic is incorrect. The current implementation updates the sequence variables `a, b, c, d` in a way that the new value `next_value` is assigned to `d`, but the previous values of `a, b, c, d` are shifted incorrectly. Specifically, `a` should be updated to `b`, `b` to `c`, `c` to `d`, and `d` to `next_value`. However, the current code shifts `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, `c` to `d`, and `d` to `next_value` without preserving the correct order, leading to incorrect sequence calculations. To fix this, the sequence variables should be updated in the correct order to maintain the proper sequence values.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case where one string has an unmatched open parenthesis and the other string has a matching closing parenthesis at the beginning. The issue in the implementation is that it only checks if the total count of parentheses is balanced but does not consider the order in which they appear.

assert add(2, 2) == 4 # output: 0

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed when all elements in the list are the same, resulting in a division by zero error. This occurs because the range_val is calculated as max_val - min_val, which becomes zero when all elements are identical. To handle this case, a check should be added to ensure that range_val is not zero before performing the division. If range_val is zero, the function should return a list of zeros or handle the case appropriately to avoid division by zero.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test case for `get_max_triples(7)` because it incorrectly counts the number of valid triples. The combinatorial counting approach used in the function does not correctly account for the combinations of elements that sum to a multiple of 3. Specifically, the function incorrectly calculates the number of triples where all three elements are congruent to the same value modulo 3 and where one element is congruent to each of the other two values modulo 3. This leads to an overestimation of the number of valid triples. To correct this, the combinatorial formulas need to be revisited to ensure they accurately count the valid triples based on their modulo 3 values.

Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(2, 2) == 4 # output: 0

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert prime_length('aa') == False # output: True

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation incorrectly identifies the length of the string 'aa' as a prime number. The issue arises because the length of 'aa' is 2, which is indeed a prime number. However, the test expects the function to return False for strings with a length of 2. This discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding in the requirements or a mistake in the test case itself. The function's logic for checking prime numbers is correct, but the test case seems to be incorrect or based on a different set of criteria not specified in the function's docstring.

Self reflection output: The implementation failed the test case due to an incorrect usage of the `is_prime` function within the `intersection` function. Specifically, the error message indicates that an object of type 'Expr' does not have an attribute 'test', which suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or misuse of the `is_prime` function's return value. The issue likely arises from how the `intersection_length` is being evaluated for primality, possibly due to a logical error in the function call or the handling of the result. To correct this, ensure that the `is_prime` function is correctly called with the `intersection_length` and that its boolean result is appropriately used to determine the return value of the `intersection` function.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

The implementation failed the test case due to an incorrect usage of the `is_prime` function within the `intersection` function. Specifically, the error message indicates that an object of type 'Expr' does not have an attribute 'test', which suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or misuse of the `is_prime` function's return type or the way it is being called. This could be due to a typo or a logical error in how the function is being utilized to determine if the length of the intersection is a prime number. To correct this, ensure that the `is_prime` function is correctly called with the calculated intersection length and that the return value is appropriately handled.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation incorrectly counts the single-digit numbers. For `n == 1`, the function should return 1 because there is only one single-digit number that starts or ends with 1, which is the number 1 itself. The current implementation incorrectly counts both starting and ending with 1 as separate cases, leading to an incorrect count of 2.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test because it incorrectly identifies the prime lengths of words. The function `is_prime` incorrectly returns `True` for numbers less than or equal to 3, which includes 1, which is not a prime number. This causes words of length 1 to be included in the result, which is incorrect based on the problem's requirements. To fix this, the `is_prime` function should return `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1 and only return `True` for numbers greater than 1 that are prime.

To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed because it incorrectly handles the condition where an index is a multiple of both 3 and 4. The current logic squares the element if its index is a multiple of 3 and cubes it if its index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. However, it does not account for the scenario where an index is both a multiple of 3 and 4, which should ideally follow the rule for being a multiple of 3 (squaring the element). This oversight leads to the incorrect transformation of elements at such indices, resulting in an incorrect sum.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.

This results in the elements at indices divisible by three being sorted among themselves but not in the context of the entire list, leading to an incorrect final order when these sorted elements are placed back into their original positions. To fix this, the implementation should ensure that the sorted elements are placed in a way that maintains their relative order with respect to the rest of the list.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed when there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters but different lengths. The issue arises because the `max` function is using a tuple as the key, where the first element is the count of unique characters and the second element is the word itself. This prioritizes words with more unique characters, and in case of a tie, it selects the lexicographically larger word. However, the lexicographical comparison is not relevant in this context, and the function should instead return the shortest word among those with the same number of unique characters. To fix this, the key function should be adjusted to prioritize the shortest word when the number of unique characters is the same.

The issue arises from the condition `elif gpa > 2.0:`, which incorrectly assigns 'C+' to GPAs that should be 'B-'. This error cascades down, causing subsequent grades to be misclassified. The correct approach should ensure that each GPA range is accurately mapped to its corresponding letter grade without overlap.

The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first.

This causes numbers like `-111` to be treated as `111`, which is correct, but numbers like `211` are also included in the check, leading to an incorrect count. The function should not take the absolute value of the number before checking the digits, as the requirement is to check both the first and last digits of the number as they appear, regardless of their sign.

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Given integers a and b, return the total value of a and b.

[unit test results from previous impl]:
Tested passed:

Tests failed:
assert add(1, 2) == 3 # output: -1
assert add(2, 2) == 4 # output: 0

[reflection on previous impl]:
The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.
